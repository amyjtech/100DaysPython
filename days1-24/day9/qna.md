# NumPy

## NumPy Q&A

### Why use Numpy?

NumPy arrays are 50x faster than Python lists. NumPy arrays are stored in a continous place in memory unlike lists, so they can be accessed and manipulated efficiently.

> NumPy is a Python library and partially written in Python, but most of the parts that require fast computation are written in C or C++

## What is the best use for NumPy?

NumPy is used to apply mathmatical operations on arrays. You can also apply arithmetic on NumPy arrays, but cannot perform arithmetic on Python lists.

> Arithmetic is a branch of mathematics that consists of the study of numbers, especially concerning the properties of the traditional operations on themâ€”addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and extraction of roots.

## Example projects with NumPy

    Example projects here

## What is the dot product?

Dot product takes 2 equally long values (usually coordinates) and returns a single number.

## What is dot product commonly used for?

The dot product is the key tool for calculating vector projections, vector decompositions, and determining orthogonality. _The operation can be used in machine learning to calculate the weighted sum of a vector._

## Why transpose?

Transpose reverses or permutes the axes of an array and returns the modified array.

> Rows become columns, the columns become rows

    a = [ 1, -2             b = [ 1, 3, 7
          3, 0        =          -2, 0, 5 ]
          7, 5 ]

## What does elementwise multiplication mean?

The multiplication is applied to each element in a matrix (array).

## What is determinant?

Calculates from the diagonal elements of a square matrix.

> For a 2x2 matrix, it is simply the subtraction of the product of the top left and bottom right element from the product of other two.
